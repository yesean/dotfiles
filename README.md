## Intro

This repo contains my configuration files for various programs that I use on
Arch Linux and macOS. I use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to help
manage my dotfiles. Each directory contains config files for its namesake
program (e.g. vim, zsh, polybar, etc) and mirrors the home directory (necessary
for stow). The
[install script](https://github.com/seanye24/dotfiles/blob/main/install.sh) uses
stow to create symlinks in your config directories and point them toward files
in the dotfiles repo. The install script will also detect the OS (macOS or
Linux) and install the dotfiles relevant to the OS.

## Prerequisites

- [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

## Getting Started

To get started, run:

```sh
cd
git clone https://github.com/seanye24/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./install.sh
```

And that's it! The config files should be installed and ready to go on your
system. The install script isn't well tested so you may want to create the
symlinks manually or perhaps pick out specific dotfiles.
