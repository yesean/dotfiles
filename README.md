# dotfiles

![screenshot](./dots.png)

- config files and scripts for Linux / macOS
- `stow` for namespacing and symlink management, e.g. `~/.zsh` points to
  `~/.dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc`

## Usage

To **install**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yesean/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./scripts/scripts/install.sh
```

> `install.sh` requires a system package manager (macOS â†’
> [`brew`](https://brew.sh/), Arch Linux â†’
> [`paru`](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) ).

The install script will bootstrap my dotfiles, installing necessary software,
creating symlinks, etc.

To **update**:

```sh
./scripts/scripts/update.sh
```

This update script will add new symlinks and update neovim (plugins, treesitter
parsers).

Installation only needs to be run once, but the dots should be updated
periodically. I try to update every couple days or when I haven't updated in a
while.

> These scripts only work on macOS and Arch Linux, as I use them daily and can
> test them out. The scripts will probably work for other Linux distros, but you
> have to edit the package manager and package names.

Or, just copy and paste a snippet or a function that looks cool! Most of this
stuff is specific to my needs, so just _use whatever you need_.

## Motivation

It was tedious manually syncing config file changes between my desktop and
laptop, so I began looking for a solution that could track changes and update
all my machines at once. I've found lots of inspiration from other people's
dotfiles, so ðŸ™‚!
